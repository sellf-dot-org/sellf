The original footage is cut, manipulated, and distorted. Using color, texture, and space through addition and subtraction, *Wandering Star* is meant to be at once familiar and unfamiliar."

    "statement": "Scientist Hans Jenny, widely considered to be the father of Cymatics conducted a series of experiments observing similarities between naturally occurring biological fractal systems and patterns produced in different liquids through sonic vibration. Based on these observations he hypothesized that all physical matter was formed by vibrations on a micro to macrocosmic scale."
